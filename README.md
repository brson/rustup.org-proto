# rustup

**rustup** is an installer and toolchain manager for the Rust programming
language. If you are programming in Rust [you should be running
rustup](https://www.rustup.rs).

## Woah! What does it do that's so special?

**rustup** installs Rust from the official release channels, allowing you
to easily switch between the stable, beta, and nightly compilers, as
well as others. It automatically updates both the installed Rust
compilers and itself. It further enables installation of optional Rust
toolchain components, such as standard libraries for cross-compiling
to other architectures.

*WARNING: This is beta software and it is known to have an appetite
  for laundry.*
